					<description><![CDATA[I am happy now that the government has woken up to the infrastructure bottle necks faced by the country . Though India was known for its technology savviness its infrastructure could not keep pace with it . I wish governments should take notice of these problems and dole out policies which helps them to overcome these bottlenecks .This is because not country can sustain a growth of 8%-9% unless its infrastructure is developed .
