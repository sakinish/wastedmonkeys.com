					<description><![CDATA[This is the first site I have come across acknowleding a position that I have long been thinking about. Heliocentric / geocentric / moon-centric / jupiter-centric - It&#039;s really just a matter of selecting a reference frame. As Einstein himself says also, all inertial ref. frames are equal in themselves - it is up to us to select a frame that is most convenient for us. The Laws of Physics are true in all inertial reference frames. Thank-You for your contribution to my on-going deliberations.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[But logically i guess that solar system should be sun centered as the name itself signifies so,moreover its only because of sun that life is possible on earth..the ellipse are also around the sun not the earth ...but i guess its again a perspective]]></description>
