					<description><![CDATA[Hi Piyush,

I would very much appreciate an invite if you have a spare!
I can&#039;t wait to peek behind the curtain that seperates Joost and I at the moment!

Thanks in advance,

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Valerio,

Thank you for your comment.

The invitation that I got was a link to download the beta version of Joost, which is not available to download from the website currently. A login name is required to be created once it is installed and run following the instructions on the screen. So if you have been able to install it, you should be able to create a login name.

Still sending you an invite, let us know if it works.]]></description>
