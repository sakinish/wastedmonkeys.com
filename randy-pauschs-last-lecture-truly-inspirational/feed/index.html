					<description><![CDATA[How inspiring Randy Pausch is! If you liked &quot;The Last Lecture&quot;, another fantastic memoir I just read and highly recommend is &quot;My Stroke of Insight&quot; by Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor. Her TEDTalk video (ted.com) has been seen as many times as The Last Lecture I think, and Oprah did 4 shows on her book, so there are a lot of similarities. In My Stroke of Insight, there&#039;s a happy ending though. It&#039;s an incredible story! I hear they&#039;re making it into a movie.]]></description>
