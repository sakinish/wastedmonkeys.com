					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the tip. Specially for explicitly telling me that running texhash means simply to type &quot;texhash&quot; in the command prompt (detail often overlooked by linux users, but a relevant one).

Maybe I can give Lyx a chance now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[HI . - I&#039;m just starting with Lyx too. I&#039;ve had it installed for ages, and just  tinkered with it, but I need to use a particular publisher&#039;s latex book style and found the lyx manual just too daunting. This little bit of advice worked straight off as far as I can see, so thanks for that. All I&#039;ve done really is install the xxx.cls into miktex and point lyx at it using the book.layout. The next thing is to try and modify the layout to take advantage of the additional elements of the publishers cls, although they say anything in latex using book.cls can be processed with their cls.]]></description>
