					<description><![CDATA[Well, what I posted there was the exact text of the sixteenth amendment to the U.S. Constitution, so I assume he must be aware of that. And it would be pretty hard to declare a federal income tax unconstitutional &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;, though if I understand you heâ€™s complaining that the way it is currently collected is in violation of the Constitution? If he feels this is so, he should sue in a court of law; it is the role of the judicial system to interpret the Constitution.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Perhaps you should send that to Mr. Russo... he seems to have spent an awful long time looking for &#039;the law&#039;! :)

One thing though... now I&#039;m not familiar with the US constitution and IRS stuff but Russo seems to suggest that all money collected by IRS goes to the Federal Reserve (which is again claimed to be a private institution). So technically the congress &#039;collecting&#039; taxes is not true... (And I need to watch this again...)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What?! What type of income do they think the tax applies to, winnings from lottery tickets?

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*shrug* seems pretty straightforward to me...]]></description>
