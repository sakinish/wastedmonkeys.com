								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;The U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday slashed U.S. interest rates (the overnight rate at which banks lend each other) by a hefty three-quarters of a percentage point, the <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUKWAT00873720080122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">biggest rate cut in more than 23 years</a>, in an emergency bid to lend support to a U.S. economy some fear is on the verge of recession&#8230; The last time there was a rate cut of at least three-quarters of a point was in October 1984.&#8221; &#8211; Reuters</p>
<p>The interest rate cut has <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uklatest/story/0,,-7245492,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">steadied the global markets</a> which were previously in a free fall.</p>
<p>As a result of Fed&#8217;s rate cut, the CBOE Market Volatility Index (VIX) (so-called stock market fear gauge) <a href="http://www.forbes.com/afxnewslimited/feeds/afx/2008/01/22/afx4557897.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spiked to its highest level</a> seen since the end of the previous bear market before paring gains, as the major stock market indexes bounced off earlier lows.</p>
