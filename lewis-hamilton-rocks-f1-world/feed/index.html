					<description><![CDATA[Interesting facts. Just two years ago we saw a new &quot;youngest world champion&quot; in F1 in the form of Fernando Alonso and last year he became the youngest double champion..This year we may either see the youngest triple champion or an all new youngest champion. Everyone was saying the same things about Alonso when he achieved his feats. Alonso made it happen in a Renault where as Hamilton has had it easy so far by being with the strongest team of the season so far. However the two time world champion is a team partner and is preferred over the rookie. Canadian GP was the first time we saw Alonso lose his most prized asset - his temprament, his cool, and made major mistakes repeatedly. It will be an exciting season to watch who wins!]]></description>
