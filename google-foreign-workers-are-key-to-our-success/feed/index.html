This of course includes computer science, software engineering and other careers which directly fall into the scope of this discussions.

There is no doubt that if the U.S. does not change it&#039;s policies it will only be subject to more off shoring of jobs, more competition in the global market, and less quality for their own consumption of products and services. I understand these measures are not to be taken lightly. Never the less, I believe this is not being handled properly, and in the coming years we will see the negative impact.]]></description>
