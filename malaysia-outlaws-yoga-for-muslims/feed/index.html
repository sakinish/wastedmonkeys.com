					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a pity. There are still some Christian sects in the West who have trouble with yoga, but the overall attitude is that it doesn&#039;t threaten faith. The first two levels are simple, commonsensical principles that can be found in all religions, the third and fourth are the sport proper. From the fifth level and up, spirituality becomes to get specific, but no yoga practitioner without aspirations to gurudom needs to ever go beyond that.

Islam will catch up... in about 600 years.]]></description>
