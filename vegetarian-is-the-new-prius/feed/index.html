					<description><![CDATA[A very thought-provoking article.
I am a life-long meat eater, and although I have for a long time had some misgivings about eating meat from an animal welfare point of view, I did not realise the cost to the environment was so high.
I just don&#039;t think I could give it up entirely.
All the same I do worry about the consequences of global warming, so I am prepare to make some sacrifices. I would be interested to know what are the relative
costs to the planet of different foods so I can make informed decisions.
For example is eating fish better than meat,  chicken better than beef? Do chickens fart?
Perhaps there is a resource somewhere which can help with this!]]></description>
