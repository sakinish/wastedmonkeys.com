					<description><![CDATA[Good one. Reminds me of Charlie Rose&#039;s  interview of  James Watson (of Watson &#038; Crick fame) and Harward Prof E.O.Wilson.
The latter referred to Darwin&#039;s Origin of Species and Watson &#038; Crick&#039;s discovery of molecular code for DNA as 2 major achievements in modern biology. Charlie Rose asked them what prospective discovery could be the next big thing.
Watson said understanding architecture of human memory- storage of information in human brain- is the next big challenge. Wilson referred to the fact that we still do not know much about the conscious mind.
The term &#039;qualia&#039; was a new one (though the idea was not).]]></description>
