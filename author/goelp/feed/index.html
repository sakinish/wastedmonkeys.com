								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thinking about thinking, this is the key. In the struggle between should versus want, some people have figured out something crucial – want never goes away.</p>
<p>Capable psychonauts who think about thinking, about states of mind, about set and setting, can get things done not because they have more will power, more drive, but because they know productivity is a game of cat and mouse versus a childish primal human predilection for pleasure and novelty which can never be excised from the soul. Your effort is better spent outsmarting yourself than making empty promises through plugging dates into a calendar or setting deadlines for push ups.</p>

<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Recently the European Commission opened a preliminary inquiry into competition complaints. Part of the  complaint alleges that Google operates without sufficient transparency  into how and why web sites rank in our search results. The notion that  Google isn&#8217;t transparent is tough for me to swallow. Google has set the  standard in how we communicate with web site publishers. Let me tell you about some of the ways we explain to sites how we rank them and why.</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">One of the most  widely-discussed parts of Google&#8217;s scoring has always been PageRank.  That &#8220;secret ingredient&#8221; is hardly a secret. <a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/%7Ebackrub/google.html">Here it is</a>. That early paper not only gave the formula for PageRank, but mentioned  many of the other signals in Google&#8217;s ranking, including anchor text,  the location of words within documents, the relative proximity of query  words in a document, the size and type of fonts used, the raw HTML of  each page, and capitalization of words. Google has continued to publish  literally <a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/papers.html">hundreds of research papers</a> over the years. Those papers reveal many of the  &#8220;secret formulas&#8221; for how Google works and <a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/gfs.html">document</a> <a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/bigtable.html">essential</a> <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2008/07/protocol-buffers-googles-data.html">infrastructure</a> that Google uses. Some of these papers have  spurred not only open-source <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">projects</a> but entire in their  own right.</span></span></div>
