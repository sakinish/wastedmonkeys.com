								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I am myself an avid user of Mozilla Firefox. But my excitement is almost drained off with latest <a href="http://firefox.l-2-l.com/" title="Firefox 2.0 download">Firefox 2.0 release</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/archives/294" title="Firefox 2.0 Recap">Firefox 2.0 Recap</a></p>
<p><span id="more-23"></span><br />
There was a time when I was all into <a href="http://www.opera.com/" title="Opera">&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic;">Opera</span>&#8220;; </a>but gotta accept that baby is too much memory intensive; and would often make my lappy-processor cry for extreme cooling! So eventually I shifted to Firefox. I found absolutely no reason to complain, until faced few issues myself.</p>
<p>Finally the biggest turnoff was the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=360493" title="Bug">bug </a>that was recently discovered. It was officially reported by Robert-Chapin. And a <a href="http://www.info-svc.com/news/11-21-2006/rcsr1/" title="Proof Of Concept">proof of concept</a> can be found here!</p>
<p>Now, I am not shifting away from firefox; but in future if I do, I would say, this was the push, that started it all! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
