					<description><![CDATA[The article mentions that Safari 4 is faster than Mozilla Minefield which is the nightly build version that gets features into Firefox. So it means that S4 is probably faster than FF3.1 as well.

Having said that FF3.1 does have a cool feature in Worker threads which enable background threads to be executed within the browser. This feature was probably NOT taken into account while performing benchmark tests.]]></description>

The must-have plugins* for Firefox limit the use of any other browser as a backup browser, at best. If only these plugins could be used in any browser...

That said, Safari is a great browser.
