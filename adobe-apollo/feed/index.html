					<description><![CDATA[... talking of stock, many analysts are upbeat on Adobe shares despite the expected mild first quarter numbers, because they say there is pent-up demand for the company&#039;s Creative Suite 3 due out later this year. Adobe Systems will host a webcast of the official launch of AdobeÂ® Creative SuiteÂ® 3, live from New York City. To participate, visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/launchevent/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; on March 27.

I am pretty sure they are going to talk about Apollo as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Apollo merges the concept of RIAs with RCAs (Rich Client Applications). More accurately, it extends RIAs to RCAs. I think this is a big leap. Given that RIAs are more portable, it appears that Flex/Flash/AJAX are going to more pervasive than ever! :) Time to buy Adobe stock!]]></description>
