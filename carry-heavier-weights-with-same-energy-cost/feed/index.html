					<description><![CDATA[I wondered the same, was actually trying to imagine how it would look. If the suspended load is too low at any given point then, it may touch obstacles on the ground that the carrier (especially soldiers) actually intended to avoid by jumping etc. The bungee must have an optimum tension which prevents this from happening, which suggests that at such events the backpack looses its function. So just like car suspensions, it also has limits. Yet, very useful.]]></description>
