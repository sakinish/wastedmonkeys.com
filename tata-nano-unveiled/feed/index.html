					<description><![CDATA[&quot;A Promise is a Promise&quot;. This is what Mr. Ratan Tata said when he launched TATA Nano. He gave a perfect answer to people who said it’s not feasible to manufacture a car in Indian Rs. 1, 00,000.
The product TATA Nano is simply amazing. TATA Nano is believed to a mileage of 24kms for every liter of fuel, 8% smaller bumper to bumper distance than Maruti 800 (competitor in India) and still 21% spacious than Maruti.
This is possible only with TATA Group. The values and culture followed at TATA Group is one of the major factors for there products being so successful. I happened to use a product called &quot;LEARN ENGLISH THROUGH LOVE AND ROMANCE&quot; an Edutainment product developed by Espoir Technologies who’s Creative Director &#038; Chief Mentor happens to be Ex VP TATA Group.
“My poor communication skills were the major obstacle for my growth in my software career. I frequently made errors in using English grammar and pronunciations, since I did my schooling in regional vernacular medium. After slogging it out for 10-12 hrs in office, reading those bulky and boring books was just not working for me. I got an opportunity to interact with some professionals from ESPOIR Technologies during their promotion campaign in my company and purchased ‘Learn English Through Love and Romance’. I never knew learning English was so easy and interesting. My career has taken a jumpstart since then”.

					<description><![CDATA[I appreciate your concern and thought. Though I value freedom of expression, shouldn&#039;t you avoid some the harsh statements you&#039;ve made? Because, it assumes you know India in all completeness and with all clarity, which is certainly not true. Your views are based on limited space-time and they are just perspectives (by definition of a &#039;view&#039;). That said, I enjoyed reading your article, it is thoughtful and well-written.]]></description>
