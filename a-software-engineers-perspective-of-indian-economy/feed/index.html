					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Prashant. Clearly a passionate positive perspective. Recently I read another article that wasn&#039;t so positive, and remarked about overheating concerns:

http://wastedmonkeys.com/2006/12/05/indias-blossoming-economy/

Personally, I think there is some aspect of that, but more importantly significant issues with finding talent and retaining talent in India. I like the idea of moving to Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities since it flattens the market place and also helps towards market stability.

Small note: I thought the article has a bias towards India, and to some extent it isn&#039;t a neutral viewpoint - something that I expected from the article!]]></description>
