								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week there were two deaths, close together; one, a class mate of mine from my school and college days; the other, a senior colleague, recently retired. Both untimely and both sudden. When in the thick of work, with the hours rushing by, as I get engrossed in files and meetings, the thought of the fragility of life never enters my mind. And why should it, I wonder: there are certain duties assigned to each of us and performing these duties is at the core of the meaning of life, as I see it. And so I, living life from minute to minute, caught in the moment, ignore tomorrow, ignore the uncertain and the unknowable. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thinking about thinking, this is the key. In the struggle between should versus want, some people have figured out something crucial – want never goes away.</p>
<p>Capable psychonauts who think about thinking, about states of mind, about set and setting, can get things done not because they have more will power, more drive, but because they know productivity is a game of cat and mouse versus a childish primal human predilection for pleasure and novelty which can never be excised from the soul. Your effort is better spent outsmarting yourself than making empty promises through plugging dates into a calendar or setting deadlines for push ups.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a few stand out above all the rest.  They change the course of history and affect the lives of millions who aren’t even aware of them.  Amazingly, they are often the work of a single person. Those ideas are truly great and seven really stand out.  To make my selection, I applied three criteria:  Longevity (i.e. they survive a long time without being amended or surpassed in any significant way), impact (i.e. they greatly affected the lives and work of others) and authorship (i.e. they can be traced to one person).  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot of Asians are not marrying later. They are not marrying at all. Almost a third of Japanese women in their early 30s are unmarried; probably half of those will always be. Over one-fifth of Taiwanese women in their late 30s are single; most will never marry. In some places, rates of non-marriage are especially striking: in Bangkok, 20% of 40-44-year old women are not married; in Tokyo, 21%; among university graduates of that age in Singapore, 27%. So far, the trend has not affected Asia’s two giants, China and India. But it is likely to, as the economic factors that have driven it elsewhere in Asia sweep through those two countries as well; and its consequences will be exacerbated by the sex-selective abortion practised for a generation there. By 2050, there will be 60m more men of marriageable age than women in China and India.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For most of my adult life, I&#8217;ve accepted the incredibly durable myth that some people are born with special talents and gifts, and that the potential to truly excel in any given pursuit is largely determined by our genetic inheritance.</p>
<p>During the past year, I&#8217;ve read no fewer than five books — and a raft of scientific research — which powerfully challenge that assumption (see below for a list). I&#8217;ve also written one, <i>The Way We&#8217;re Working Isn&#8217;t Working</i>, which lays out a guide, grounded in the science of high performance, to systematically building your capacity physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. </p>
