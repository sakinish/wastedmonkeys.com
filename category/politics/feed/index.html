								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India has an unmatched capacity to look opportunity firmly in the face, turn around, and walk off resolutely in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The latest manifestation of the national pastime comes in relation to public corruption. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh could have appropriated the cause and channelled the people&#8217;s movement to enact tough new laws to rid India of corrupt practices and cement its economic future. Instead he has responded with vacillation and, by using the powers of the state to intimidate activists, planted his flag on the wrong side of history.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now, to the heart of the issue: China. You can think of China as a foxy young girl who knows she&#8217;s smokin&#8217; hot. She&#8217;s happy to hang out at the club and lure people over to buy her drinks, and even though she&#8217;d chat and humor him a bit just to keep him talking and buying drinks, she&#8217;d never dream of putting out. Instead, once her suitor had fulfilled his usefulness or she became bored, she&#8217;d feign indignation, throw a fit, and then freeze him out. Yes, in spite of her charm and confidence in her looks, there&#8217;s something bothering her on the inside: even though others compliment her beauty and tell her she&#8217;s special, she looks over to the VIP table and her gut sinks. Why don&#8217;t those other people accept her? That&#8217;s all she wants! </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <i>Sociopaths</i> enter and exit organizations at will, at any stage, and do whatever it takes to come out on top. They contribute creativity in early stages of a organization’s life, neurotic leadership in the middle stages, and cold-bloodedness in the later stages,  where they drive decisions like mergers, acquisitions and layoffs that others are too scared or too compassionate to drive. The <i>Losers</i> like to feel good about their lives. They are the happiness seekers, rather than will-to-power players, and enter and exit reactively, in response to the meta-Darwinian trends in the economy. But they have no more loyalty to the firm than the sociopaths. They do have a loyalty to individual people, and a commitment to finding fulfillment through work when they can, and coasting when they cannot. The <i>Clueless</i> are the ones who lack the competence to circulate freely through the economy (unlike sociopaths and losers), and build up a perverse sense of loyalty to the firm, even when events make it abundantly clear that the firm is not loyal to them. To sustain themselves, they must be capable of fashioning elaborate delusions based on idealized notions of the firm — the perfectly pathological entities we mentioned. Unless squeezed out by forces they cannot resist, they hang on as long as possible, long after both sociopaths and losers have left.</p>
<p>The Gervais Principle is this: Sociopaths, in their own best interests, knowingly promote over-performing losers into middle-management, groom under-performing losers into sociopaths, and leave the average bare-minimum-effort losers to fend for themselves.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In our subprime era, we thought we could have the American dream — a house and yard — with nothing down. This version of the American dream was delivered not by improving education, productivity and savings, but by Wall Street alchemy and borrowed money from Asia. A year ago, it all exploded. Now that we are picking up the pieces, we need to understand that it is not only our financial system that needs a reboot and an upgrade, but also our public school system. Otherwise, the jobless recovery won’t be just a passing phase, but our future.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The imaginary line now known as the Greenwich Prime Meridian not only allows us to navigate the globe but also keeps the world ticking to the same symbolic 24-hour clock. But it has not always been so. Until the 19th Century, many countries and even individual towns kept their own local time based on the sun&#8217;s passage across the sky and there were no international rules governing when the day would start or finish.</p>
<p>How did Britain get to be the centre of all time and space? The real reason the meridian is at Greenwich is that the Astronomer Royal at Greenwich was the first &#8211; indeed, really the only &#8211; person to have done the research required to calculate navigational tables. He naturally took his own telescope as the baseline, and once the nautical almanacs which resulted were published no-one could be bothered to do the research all over again merely to establish a different base. It&#8217;s important to note that the meridian is at Greenwich, not Charing Cross: so it honours a great scientist rather than Britain. And who was that scientist? None other than Nevil Maskelyne, the villain of Dava Sobel&#8217;s popular book Longitude, but arguably the real solver of the longitude problem.</p>
