								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MOST governments say they want to encourage entrepreneurs. Yet when foreigners with ideas come knocking, they slam doors in their faces. America, surprisingly, is one of the worst offenders. It has no specific visa for foreigners who wish to create new companies. It does offer a visa for investors, but the requirements are so stiff—usually an initial investment of $1m, or half that if the firm is in a depressed neighbourhood—that the annual quota of 10,000 visas is seldom filled. Other countries are more open (see table). Singapore offers visas to  people who invest $40,000; for some, the government provides additional  investment. Britain gives visas to entrepreneurs who meet certain  conditions and attract £50,000 ($77,000) of venture funding. New Zealand has no specific capital requirement but offers residency to  entrepreneurs whose firms are deemed to benefit the country. Chile is  wildly generous: its government gives selected start-ups $40,000 without taking any equity in return.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot of Asians are not marrying later. They are not marrying at all. Almost a third of Japanese women in their early 30s are unmarried; probably half of those will always be. Over one-fifth of Taiwanese women in their late 30s are single; most will never marry. In some places, rates of non-marriage are especially striking: in Bangkok, 20% of 40-44-year old women are not married; in Tokyo, 21%; among university graduates of that age in Singapore, 27%. So far, the trend has not affected Asia’s two giants, China and India. But it is likely to, as the economic factors that have driven it elsewhere in Asia sweep through those two countries as well; and its consequences will be exacerbated by the sex-selective abortion practised for a generation there. By 2050, there will be 60m more men of marriageable age than women in China and India.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of course this leads to the question, &#8220;What is success?&#8221; Someone who spent his life working 80 hour weeks, living in hotels, and fighting his way up the corporate ladder to become VP of toilet paper marketing would probably consider himself more successful than a sandwich shop owner who spends his nights and weekends playing with his kids and working on hobby projects, but maybe the sandwich shop owner would be happier and healthier. Ultimately, it is up to each person to decide what success means to them, but I think it&#8217;s important that everyone be mindful of the decision they are making. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now, to the heart of the issue: China. You can think of China as a foxy young girl who knows she&#8217;s smokin&#8217; hot. She&#8217;s happy to hang out at the club and lure people over to buy her drinks, and even though she&#8217;d chat and humor him a bit just to keep him talking and buying drinks, she&#8217;d never dream of putting out. Instead, once her suitor had fulfilled his usefulness or she became bored, she&#8217;d feign indignation, throw a fit, and then freeze him out. Yes, in spite of her charm and confidence in her looks, there&#8217;s something bothering her on the inside: even though others compliment her beauty and tell her she&#8217;s special, she looks over to the VIP table and her gut sinks. Why don&#8217;t those other people accept her? That&#8217;s all she wants! </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In our subprime era, we thought we could have the American dream — a house and yard — with nothing down. This version of the American dream was delivered not by improving education, productivity and savings, but by Wall Street alchemy and borrowed money from Asia. A year ago, it all exploded. Now that we are picking up the pieces, we need to understand that it is not only our financial system that needs a reboot and an upgrade, but also our public school system. Otherwise, the jobless recovery won’t be just a passing phase, but our future.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s some news that&#8217;s not &#8216; sweet&#8217; at all: Every sixth diabetic in the world is an Indian, making the country the world&#8217;s diabetes capital. New data released on Tuesday shows India has over 50 million diabetics out of the world&#8217;s 285 million. The disease is affecting more people in the working age group and is proving to be an economic burden, according to the figures released by the International Diabetes Federation. With 50.8 million diabetics, India tops the global tally. China with 43.2 million patients comes second, followed by the US where 26.8 million people suffer from the disease. The disease will cost the world economy at least $376 billion (over Rs 17 lakh crore) in 2010.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A long wait for a green card, coupled with the soft U.S. economy, is prompting an exodus of some of the best and brightest &#8212; Lured by the prospect of climbing to the top of his field, New Delhi native Swaroop Ganguly came to the U.S. 10 years ago and earned a PhD in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 2005. He became an expert in an emerging technology called spintronics, used to power semiconductors, and worked at several chip companies, including Freescale Semiconductor. But Ganguly, now 32, is moving back to India this summer. Although he has been doing postdoctoral work at the University of Texas, he figures his prospects for research and professional development are probably better in his home country. &#8220;I feel quite excited about going back,&#8221; he says. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China&#8217;s central bank has called for the creation of a new global currency as an alternative to the dollar, in the latest sign of that country&#8217;s growing assertiveness on the international stage. But would the idea even work? China has more than $1 trillion in U.S. Treasuries and other government securities, analysts estimate — and the country doesn&#8217;t keep all of that money in its own currency because that would cause inflation. Also, by buying assets in dollars, China keeps the yuan from strengthening too much against the U.S. currency — which would make its goods more expensive to American consumers and hurt Chinese exports. But as the U.S. government ramps up spending to stimulate the economy and assist the battered financial sector, Chinese officials are worried that inflation will result — and that would erode the value of their dollar holdings, economists said.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian Americans are in fact a new &#8220;model minority.&#8221; Despite constituting less than 1% of the U.S. population, Indian-Americans are 3% of the nation&#8217;s engineers, 7% of its IT workers and 8% of its physicians and surgeons. The overrepresentation of Indians in these fields is striking&#8211;in practical terms, your doctor is nine times more likely to be an Indian-American than is a random passerby on the street. So why do Indian Americans perform so well? A natural answer is self-selection. Someone willing to pull up roots and move halfway around the world will tend to be more ambitious and hardworking than the average person.</p>
