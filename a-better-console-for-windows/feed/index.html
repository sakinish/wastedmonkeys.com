					<description><![CDATA[I discovered Console thanks to you monkeys and I love it! A few tips to get the most out of it:
1. Keep up to date - check sourceforge for the latest beta builds.
2. Add Console to the Explorer &quot;Send to...&quot; list to open prompts in directories via the context menu. To do so, create a shortcut to console.exe in C:Documents and Settings\SendTo,  and append &quot; -d&quot; to the shortcut target.
3. Don&#039;t hesitate to explore the setting and re-configure the keys &#038; mouse actions, which are very flexible. For example, it&#039;s not hard to get Putty-like quick copy/paste.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sysinternals (now taken over by Microsoft) have a new tool that shows what programs are run at startup.

Very illuminating to show how much is running. Win3.1 used to have feature that if you held down shift whilst windows was starting it didn&#039;t load any extras.  Pity that has gone away!

					<description><![CDATA[Yes - this is a great program.. I use it exclusively now. It doesn&#039;t quite resize correctly, so you can&#039;t have the window exactly the size you want but that&#039;s a price worth paying I think.]]></description>
